Detection of Skin Cancer Based on Skin Lesion Images Using Deep Learning

### Description  
Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide. Well, some studies show that if you get more than 5 sunburns your chances of getting a malignant cancer doubles. One of the proven method to detect skin cancer is using a subpart of artificial intelligence, Deep Learning. In this research, the deep learning method convolution neural network (CNN) was used to detect the two primary types of tumors, malignant and benign, using the ISIC2019 dataset. Further, another prediction was run to detect the "type" of the skin cancer which makes it both binary and a multi-class classification problem.

1. Malignant or Benign : The binary model predicted 77% accuracy and 68.9% recall value in detecting cancer. A good recall value is crucial because the recall measures the model's ability to detect Positive samples.
2. Type of cancer : The second model achieved an accuracy of 70.3% and a recall value of 64.3%.
